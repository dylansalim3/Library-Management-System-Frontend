# Primary School Library Management System Frontend
## Description
Through the Primary School Library management systems, librarians can keep track of the books and their checkouts, as well as members’ profiles. The Primary School Library management systems also involve maintaining the database for entering new books and recording books that have been borrowed with their respective due dates. The library system also provides an easy way to register user accounts, user accounts can be registered using csv files and normal form registrations.
